The goal of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is to classify optical patterns (often contained in a digital image) corresponding to alphanumeric or other characters. The process of OCR involves several steps including segmentation, feature extraction, and classification.
Therefore, Text capture is a process to convert analogue text-based resources into digitally recognisable text resources. These digital text resources can be represented in many ways such as searchable text in indexes to identify documents or page images, or as full text resources. An essential first stage in any text capture process from analogue to digital will be to create a scanned image of the page side. This will provide the base for all other processes. The next stage may then be to use a technology known as Optical Character Recognition to convert the text content into a machine-readable format. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a type of document image analysis where a scanned digital image that contains either machine printed, or handwritten script is input into an OCR software engine and translating it into an editable machine-readable digital text format (like ASCII text). OCR works by first pre-processing the digital page image into its smallest component parts with layout analysis to find text blocks, sentence/line blocks, word blocks and character blocks. Other features such as lines, graphics, photographs etc are recognised and discarded.
